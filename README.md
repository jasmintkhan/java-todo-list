# Java Todo List Application
(java-todo-list)

## Description
This repository contains two versions of a simple application to manage daily tasks. The first is a basic Java application, and the second is an enhanced version with a Spring Boot-based UI. This project serves as a learning platform for mastering Java development, understanding UI principles, and becoming proficient with Git and GitHub.

## Structure
- **Java Version:** The original console-based application.
- **Spring Boot Version:** An enhanced version with a web-based UI.

## Installation and Setup
Prerequisites include Java, Maven, and Git. To set up and run the application:

### Java Version
- **Prerequisites:** Ensure Java is installed on your system.
- **Running the Application:** Navigate to the `src` directory of the Java version and compile the code using `javac FileName.java`, then run it using `java FileName`.

### Spring Boot Version
- **Prerequisites:** Ensure Java and Maven are installed on your system.
- **Running the Application:** Navigate to the root of the Spring Boot version and run `mvn spring-boot:run`. The application will start, and you can access it via `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## Usage
- **Java Version:** The console-based application will guide you through the available commands once started.
- **Spring Boot Version:** Access the application through your web browser. You'll be greeted with a simple UI where you can view, add, delete, and update tasks.

## Contributing
